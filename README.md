# river-peak-flows-project

We will use the online and offline dataset provided by the supervisor to use computer vision algorithms to improve the current engineering formulas in estimating peak flows in smaller river catchments in Estonia. These peak flows are used for hydraulic sizing culverts and other water conveyance systems like ditches and even smaller bridges. The idea is to revise the current formulas to provide a better design basis, but still easy to employ, for engineers in the relevant field.

Here is all the work done, link should be accessible to anyone: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1QFGAQWkt99bGyZogUzaRsPIfiU3vm4_k#scrollTo=dY7VZvl2XTf3
